# Detecting Brute Force Attacks
## What is Brute Forcing?
Brute forcing is a type of attack that involves attempting to guess a password or authentication token by systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found. In the context of web attacks, brute forcing typically refers to the process of using automated tools to repeatedly submit login requests to a web application using different username and password combinations until a valid one is discovered.

Brute force attacks can be used to gain unauthorized access to a system, steal sensitive information, or launch further attacks against the target or other systems. They can be particularly effective against weak or poorly protected passwords, but can also be very time-consuming and resource-intensive for the attacker, especially if the target system has implemented measures to detect and block brute force attacks.

Brute force attacks are one of the simplest and most straightforward methods of attacking a web application, and it works by systematically trying every possible combination of usernames and passwords until the correct one is found. This process is typically automated using specialized software or scripts, which can try thousands or even millions of combinations per second.

The basic idea behind a brute force attack is to exploit the weak or easily guessable passwords that a lot of people use especially the non-techy users, such as common dictionary words, simple number sequences, or their own names or birthdates. By systematically trying every possible combination of characters, attackers can eventually find the correct password and gain access to the target system.

## Brute Forcing Possible Vectors
Brute forcing on web applications is a common attack vector used by hackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or web servers. In this type of attack, the attacker will use automated tools to submit multiple login requests to the targeted web application using different usernames and passwords, in an attempt to find the correct credentials and gain access to the system.

Web applications are particularly vulnerable to brute force attacks because they are often accessible over the internet and rely on user authentication to control access to sensitive data or functionality. If an attacker is able to guess a valid username and password, they can potentially gain access to sensitive user data, such as financial information, personal data, or confidential business information. 

Actually, it’s not just guessing usernames and passwords also, directory brute forcing on web applications is another type of brute force attack that involves guessing file or directory names on a web server in order to find hidden or sensitive files or directories. In this type of attack, the attacker will use automated tools to submit requests to the targeted web server using different file or directory names, in an attempt to find files or directories that are not meant to be publicly accessible.

This type of attack can be effective against web applications that do not implement proper access controls or that have poorly configured web servers. To prevent directory brute force attacks, web application developers can implement access controls to restrict access to sensitive files and directories, and can configure their web servers to block requests for known sensitive files and directories.

## How Brute Forcing Works?
Here's an example of vulnerable code that is susceptible to Brute Forcing attacks in a PHP script:

This form is vulnerable to brute force attacks because it allows unlimited login attempts and does not implement any security measures to prevent automated login attempts.

Here's an example of how you can use Python requests library to send multiple login requests with a list of usernames and passwords:

## Impact of Brute Forcing
Brute forcing can have significant impacts on a target system or application. Here are some of the potential impacts of brute forcing:
- Denial of service: Brute forcing can consume a significant amount of computing resources, such as CPU cycles and memory, which can lead to system slowdowns or crashes. This can cause a denial of service (DoS) attack, which makes the target system unavailable to legitimate users.
- Data leakage: Successful brute force attacks can allow unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as login credentials, personal information, financial data, and intellectual property. This can lead to data breaches, which can have severe consequences for the target organization, including financial losses and damage to reputation.
- Account takeover: Brute forcing can allow attackers to gain access to user accounts without the owner's consent. Once an attacker has access to an account, they can carry out malicious activities, such as stealing data, sending spam, or carrying out further attacks.
- Password reuse: Brute forcing can reveal weak or easily guessable passwords, which can encourage users to reuse passwords across multiple accounts. This can increase the risk of compromise, as a successful brute force attack on one account can provide access to multiple accounts.
- Legal and reputational consequences: Brute forcing is illegal and unethical, and can result in significant legal and reputational consequences for individuals and organizations who engage in it. If caught, attackers can face criminal charges, fines, and other penalties. Additionally, organizations who are victims of brute force attacks may suffer reputational damage, loss of trust from customers and stakeholders, and legal liability for failing to protect their systems and data.

Prevention Methods for Brute Forcing
- Implement account lockout policies: After a certain number of failed login attempts, lock the user account for a specified period of time, to prevent further login attempts. This will make brute force attacks more difficult, as the attacker will need to wait for the account to become unlocked before attempting more login attempts.
- Implement CAPTCHA: Use CAPTCHA or other bot detection mechanisms to detect automated login attempts and prevent them from succeeding.
- Limit the rate of login attempts: Implement a mechanism that limits the number of login attempts that can be made within a certain time period (e.g. 5 login attempts per minute). This will slow down brute force attacks, as the attacker will need to wait between attempts.
- Use multi-factor authentication: Require users to provide additional authentication factors, such as a one-time code sent via SMS or email, in addition to their username and password.
- Monitoring login attempts: This involves monitoring login attempts for signs of suspicious activity, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address, or unusual spikes in traffic or requests. This can help to detect and prevent brute force attacks before they are successful.
- Using strong passwords and password policies: This involves requiring users to choose strong passwords that are difficult to guess, and enforcing password policies that require users to change their passwords regularly and prohibiting the use of weak or easily guessable passwords.

Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are commonly used to protect web applications from various types of attacks, including brute force attacks. Here are some ways WAFs can prevent brute force attacks; 

IP blocking: WAFs can block access to the web application from IP addresses that have made excessive login attempts or have triggered other security rules. This can prevent brute force attacks by blocking the attacker's access to the application altogether.

User behavior analysis: WAFs can analyze user behavior patterns to detect abnormal activity, such as a high rate of login attempts or unusual login times. This can help prevent brute force attacks by detecting and blocking suspicious behavior before it becomes a problem.

It's important to note that WAFs are not foolproof and can be bypassed by skilled attackers. Therefore, it's important to implement multiple layers of security controls, such as strong passwords, account lockout policies, and security awareness trainings for users, in addition to using  WAFs.

By implementing these measures, the login form can be more secure, robust, and resistant to brute-force attacks.

## Detecting Brute Forcing Attacks
In Part 1, we have described what the Brute Forcing is and how to prevent this attack type. In this part, we’ll have a look at the detection techniques and some tips to make it easier to detect and prevent brute force attacks.

Analyzing brute force attacks can help you understand the methods used by attackers and identify vulnerabilities in your security controls. To do this, you should collect and store authentication logs from your web application, including the successful logins as well as the failed login attempts. Look for patterns of suspicious activity in the authentication logs, such as a high number of failed login attempts from a particular IP address or user account. Analyze network traffic logs to identify patterns of traffic that may be associated with brute force attacks, such as repeated login attempts from the same IP address or requests to non-existent pages or directories. 

Deploy an intrusion detection system (IDS) or intrusion prevention system (IPS) to analyze network traffic and detect signs of brute force attacks. Look for common attack vectors used in brute force attacks, such as dictionary attacks or password spraying. Identify user accounts that are vulnerable to brute force attacks due to weak passwords or other vulnerabilities. Finally, monitor for incidents of brute force attacks and respond to them promptly by blocking malicious IP addresses, locking out user accounts, and implementing additional security controls as necessary. By following these steps, you can strengthen your security controls and reduce the risk of successful brute force attacks.

To detect brute force attacks in nginx log files, you can use various tools and techniques such as:
- Log analysis tools: There are several log analysis tools such as Logstash, ElasticSearch, and Kibana (ELK Stack) that can help you analyze nginx log files and detect brute force attacks. These tools will allow you to search for specific patterns in the log files, such as repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address or user agent.
- Regular expressions: Regular expressions can be used to search for specific patterns in the log files. For example, you can use a regular expression to match a sequence of repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address or user agent.

Things that you can do after the detection:
- Fail2ban: Fail2ban is a popular intrusion prevention tool that can be used to automatically block the IP addresses that are detected as engaging in brute force attacks. Fail2ban works by monitoring the nginx log files and applying predefined filters to detect and block suspicious activity.
- IP blocking: You can manually block IP addresses that are detected as engaging in brute force attacks by adding them to the nginx configuration file. For example, you can use the deny rule to block traffic from specific IP addresses:
