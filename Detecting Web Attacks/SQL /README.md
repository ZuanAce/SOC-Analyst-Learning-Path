# Detecting SQL Injection Attacks
## What is SQL Injection (SQLi)?
SQL Injections are critical attack vectors in which a web application directly includes unsanitized user-provided data in SQL queries.

The frameworks we use today to develop web applications have preventative mechanisms in place to protect against SQL Injection attacks. However, we still come across SQL injection vulnerabilities because sometimes raw SQL queries are used, sometimes the framework has an inherent SQL injection vulnerability, or the framework is not used properly.

## Types of SQL Injections
There are 3 types of SQL Injection. These are: 
- In-band SQLi (Classic SQLi): When an SQL query is sent and responded to on the same channel, we call this in-band SQLi. This is easier for attackers to exploit than other categories of SQLi.
- Inferential SQLi (Blind SQLi): SQL queries that receive a response that cannot be seen are called Inferential SQLi. They are also called "Blind SQLi" because the response cannot be seen.
- Out-of-band SQLi: If the response to an SQL query is communicated through another channel, this type of SQLi is called "out-of-band SQLi". For example, if the attacker receives replies to the SQL queries via DNS, this is called out-of-band SQLi.

## How Does SQL Injection Work?
Today, most standard web applications receive data from a user and use that data to display specific content. The login page is where most SQL injection attacks occur. Let's look at how SQL injections work through an example.

A user is usually expected to enter their username and password on the login page. Then, on the other side, the web application will use this username and password information to create an SQL query like the one below:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'USERNAME’ AND password = 'USER_PASSWORD'`

The meaning of this SQL query is "Bring me all the information about the user from the user's table whose name is USERNAME and whose password is USER_PASSWORD". If the web application finds a matching user, it will authenticate the user, if it cannot find a user after executing the query, the login will fail.

Let's say your username is "john" and your password is "supersecretpassword". When you enter this information and click the 'Login' button, the SQL query shown below will be queried and you will be able to log in because a match was found after the SQL query.

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘john’ AND password = 'supersecretpassword'`

So what if we do not use this system as it was designed and we put an apostrophe (') in the username field? The SQL query will look like this and the error will be excluded from the database because the query was incorrect.

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘john’’ AND password = 'supersecretpassword'`

Of course, an attacker would be pleased to get an error message, as they can manipulate the information in the error message to their advantage. It also shows that the attacker is on the right track. So what if the attacker enters a payload like the following in the username section?

`‘ OR 1=1 -- -`

When the attacker submits the payload, the web application executes the following SQL query:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘’ OR 1=1 -- - AND password = 'supersecretpassword'`

In SQL, any characters after "-- -" are considered to be a comment line. So if we look at the query above, the characters after "-- -" mean nothing. So, for the sake of simplicity, let's remove that part before we examine the SQL query further.

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘’ OR 1=1`

The query above now looks like this "if the username is empty or 1=1". It does not matter whether the username field is empty or not, because 1 is always equal to 1. So this query will always be true and will most likely call the first entry in the database. The attacker will be able to successfully enter the web application because there is a match.

This is a typical SQL injection attack. Of course, SQL injection attacks are not limited to this example, the attacker could use SQL to execute commands in the system using SQL commands such as xp_cmdshell.

## What Attackers Gain from SQL Injection Attacks
To understand why SQL injection attacks are so important, let's take a look at what an SQL injection attack can do.
- Authentication bypass
- Command execution
- Exfiltration of sensitive data
- Creating/Deleting/Updating database entries

## How to Prevent SQL Injections
- Use a framework: Of course, just using a framework is not enough to prevent a SQL injection attack. However, it is still very important to use the framework according to the documentation.
- Keep your framework up to date: Keep your web application secure by following security updates according to the framework you use.
- Always sanitize data received from a user: Never trust data received from a user. In addition, sanitize all data (such as headers, URLs, etc.), not just form data.
- Avoid the use of raw SQL queries: You may be in the habit of writing raw SQL queries, but you should take advantage of the security provided by the framework.

## Detecting SQL Injection Attacks
In the previous section, we discussed what an attacker can do with a SQL injection attack. Each of the results of a SQL Injection mentioned above can cause great damage to an organization, so as SOC analysts we should be able to detect these attacks and take precautions against them.

So how do we detect SQL injection attacks?

There is more than one answer to this question:
- When examining a web request, check all areas that come from the user: As SQL injection attacks are not limited to the form areas, you should also check the HTTP request headers such as the "User-Agent".
- Look for SQL keywords: Look for words such as "INSERT", "SELECT", and "WHERE" in the data received from users.
- Check any special characters: Look for apostrophes ('), dashes (-), or parentheses used in SQL or special characters commonly used in SQL attacks in the data received from the user.
- Familiarise yourself with commonly used SQL injection payloads: Although SQL payloads change depending on the web application, attackers still use some common payloads to test for SQL injection vulnerabilities. If you are familiar with these payloads, you can easily detect SQL injection payloads. You can find some commonly used SQL injection payloads here.

## Detecting Automated SQL Injection Tools
Attackers use many automated tools to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities. One of the well-known tools is Sqlmap. However, let's look at the bigger picture rather than focusing on one particular tool.

You can use the following methods to detect SQL injection tools:
- Look at the User-Agent: Automated tools usually have their names and versions recorded. You can look at the User-Agent to detect these automated tools.
- Check the frequency of requests: Automated tools are designed to send an estimated number of requests per second to test payloads as quickly as possible. A normal user might send 1 request per second, so looking at the number of requests per second will tell you if the requests are from an automated tool or not.
- Look at the content of the payload: Automated tools usually include their own names in their payloads. For example, an SQL injection payload sent by an automated tool might look like this: sqlmap’ OR 1=1
- If the payload is complicated: This detection method may not always work, but based on my experience I could say that automated tools send more complicated payloads.
