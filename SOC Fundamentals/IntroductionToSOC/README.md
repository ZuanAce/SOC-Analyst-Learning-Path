# Introduction to SOC

## If You Want To Become a SOC Analyst
If becoming a SOC Analyst is your career goal, we recommend you focus on SOC tools such as SIEM, Log Management, and EDR, and take notes.

## What is a SOC?
A Security Operation Center (SOC) is a facility where the information security team continuously monitors and analyzes the security of an organization. The primary purpose of the SOC team is to detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents using technology, people, and processes.

## Types of SOC Models
Depending on your security needs and budget, there are several types of SOCs:
- In-house SOC: This team is formed when an organization builds its cybersecurity team. Organizations considering an internal SOC should have a budget to support its continuity.
- Virtual SOC: This type of SOC team does not have a permanent facility and often works remotely in various locations.
- Co-Managed SOC: The Co-Managed SOC consists of internal SOC staff working with an external Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP). Coordination is key in this type of model.
- Command SOC: This SOC team oversees smaller SOCs across a large region. Organizations using this model include large telecommunications providers and defense agencies.

## People, Process, and Technology
- People: A strong SOC team requires highly trained personnel who are familiar with security alerts and attack scenarios. Because attack types are constantly changing, you need team members who can easily adapt to new attack types and are willing to conduct research.
- Process: To further develop your SOC structure, you need to align it with many different types of security requirements, such as NIST, PCI, and HIPAA. All processes require extreme standardization of actions to ensure nothing is left out.
- Technology: The team needs to have different products for many tasks, such as penetration testing, detection, prevention, and analysis, and they need to follow the market and technology closely to find the best solution for the organization. Sometimes the best product on the market may not be the best product for your team. Remember to consider other factors such as the organization's budget.

## SOC Roles
- SOC Analyst: This role can be categorized as Level 1, 2, and 3 according to the SOC structure. A security analyst classifies the alert, looks for the cause, and advises on remediation.
- Incident Responder: An Incident Response Officer is an individual responsible for threat detection. This role performs the initial assessment of security breaches.
- Threat Hunter: A Threat Hunter is a cybersecurity professional who proactively seeks out and investigates potential threats and vulnerabilities within an organization's network or system. They use a combination of manual and automated techniques to detect, isolate, and mitigate advanced persistent threats (APTs) and other sophisticated attacks that may evade traditional security measures. Threat hunters typically have a deep understanding of the organization's IT infrastructure and security posture, as well as knowledge of emerging threats and attack tactics. They aim to find and eliminate threats before they can damage or disrupt the business.
- Security Engineer: Security engineers are responsible for maintaining the security infrastructure of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions and security operations center (SOC) products. For example, a security engineer builds the connection between SIEM and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) products.
- SOC Manager: A SOC manager takes on management responsibilities such as budgeting, strategizing, managing staff, and coordinating operations. They deal with operational rather than technical issues.

## SOC Analyst and Their Responsibilities
- A SOC Analyst is the first person to investigate threats to a system. If the situation demands it, they escalate incidents to their supervisors so they can mitigate threats. The SOC Analyst plays an important role on the SOC team because they are the first person to respond to a threat.

## The Advantages of Being a SOC Analyst
There are many various techniques for attack vectors and malicious software and they increase more and more every day. As an analyst you will get greater enjoyment from investigating these varying types of incidents. Even though the operating systems, security products, etc. that you use will be the same the job will feel less monotonous because you will be analyzing different incidents. Also, you may not encounter such techniques (not every week or every day).

## A Day in the Life of a SOC Analyst
To be a successful SOC analyst who is not dependent on security products and can correctly analyze SIEM alerts, you must have the following skills and abilities.
- Operating Systems: To determine what is abnormal in a system, you first need to know what is accepted as normal. For example, there are many services within the Windows operating system, and it is difficult to know which ones are suspicious without knowing which ones are or could be considered normal Windows services. Therefore, you should be familiar with how Windows/Linux operating systems work.
- Network: First and foremost, in this role, you will be dealing with a lot of malicious IPs and URLs, so you need to confirm that there are no devices on the network trying to connect to those addresses. Once you accomplish that, it will set the direction of the analysis. This step is a bit more complicated because you may have to find a potential data leak on the network. To perform all of these functions, you need to understand the basics of networking.
- Malware Analysis: When dealing with most threats, you are likely to encounter some type of malicious software. To understand the real purpose of these malicious programs (they sometimes display different behaviors to fool analysts), you need to have malware analysis skills. It is important to at least determine what the command and control center of the malicious file is and whether or not there is a device communicating with that address.
